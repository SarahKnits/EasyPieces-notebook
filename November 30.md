# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

This week, I spent some time on user tests. I asked people to read through the
tutorial I wrote and create a graph for a sample program I provided. I found
that people initially tended to forget the open curly brace, but that they 
caught on when I explained my reasoning behind it. I'm not sure whether I should
remove the curly braces or if I should explain the reasoning behind it more
explicitly in the tutorial. My main idea is to use that to distinguish between
pieces and full functions that would be over the entire domain. 

This week I also spent time working on the name and logo of the project (some in
class, continued outside of class). My name will be EasyPieces and the logo will
be the text generated using the grapher. I considered using this as a demo with
the project, but decided against it as it isn't really in the spirit of the
project (multiple lines in the same place, not truly piecewise).

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Before the end of the project, I have the following to accomplish: 
* Adding useful error messages targeted at specific users
* Correct issue with lines not showing up for horizontal lines
* Add support for personalizing labels for axes, titles, and file names

The most pressing of these at this point is correcting the issue with horizontal
lines, followed by error messages, with personalized labels the lowest priority
of the remaining items. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent two and a half hours brainstorming for and writing the Preliminary 
Evaluation, one hour testing the program with users of various backgrounds and
evaluating their responses, one hour writing the design notebook, a half hour
outside of class completing my logo, one hour expanding my language.
