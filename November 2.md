# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

This week was spent largely refining my project idea. I initially was focused
on writing my own graphing tool. Now I am leaning more toward using an existing
graphing tool and just making piece-wise graphs easier and more intuitive.

I plan to use Grapher and its incomplete piece-wise graphing and other
capabilties to make a full piece-wise graphing tool.  

Some of the graphing tools I looked at were Grapher, Mathematica, Matlab, 
and the basic graphing possible in Excel. I found that, although it is possible
to create a complete piecewise graph, it requires multiple steps and is not
intuitive (I had to look at tutorials to figure it out).

My goal is to use a syntax that translates more closely from math to produce
the graphs.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

One of the most important decisions I need to make is what the MVP and stretch
goals will be. I want to have a limited scope to begin with and then modules
that can be added as time permits. I also need to decide what language I will
be using and if Grapher is the best tool for the job.  

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What would be your ideal input for graphing piecewise functions?

What features would you want beyond piecewise and simple 2D graphs?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about 1 hour brainstorming ideas, 2 hours researching existing
programs, 1 hour discussing ideas with others in the class, and 1 hour on 
write-up. I have worked on my own.

## Post-critique summary

Alex emphasized the importance of finding a good graphing software to cut down
on the amount of coding I have to do. He also suggested that I stick with the
piecewise functions and simple 2D functions initially and then expand after 
that if there is still time. He also suggested variables to hold reusable
code fragments. 

## Post-critique reflection

I like the idea of using variables to store reusable code fragments to prevent
the user having to retype a piece over and over. 

I know that the graphing API will be the most important decision to make, as it
will define what will be possible and easy to implement in my language. I also
recognize that the design decisions are otherwise somewhat limited, and that I
may need to expand my scope to include more creativity and designing.
